# What exactly does cURL do?
I am certainly no cURL expert and it's quite difficult giving an exact explanation so I will try and give the most basic and simple explanation.
curl means `client URL` and you already know from above that it's a command line tool, it's basically a tool that permits/enables data transfer over many network protocols (HTTPS, HTTP, FTP, it also support SSL Certificates). The tool communicates with a web server with a URL and tells the server the data to be sent or received.(Yes you read that correctly, **the tool can do both**)

# Installation
I simply installed cURL with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/curl)
<br>
Install Command: 
```$ brew install curl```
<br>

Once you have installed cURL, you can also install Grep: (more info on `grep` later on)
<br>
Install Command: 
```$ brew install grep```

<br>

# Commands
Now that you have everything installed, we are good to go âœ…, so let's have a look at some commands for OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
